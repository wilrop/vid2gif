# vid2gif
Vid2gif is a small script written out of pure boredom to convert a segment of a video into a GIF.

## How it works
It is very simple. You just give it the path to your video file (mp4 only), the beginning second of this video that you want to start your GIF at and the ending timestamp that you want to end your GIF with.
It is also possible to give an optional parameter `--save_to` as a way to control where the newly generated GIf is actually exported to.
