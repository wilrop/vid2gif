# vid2gif
Vid2gif is a small script written out of pure boredom to convert a segment of a video into a GIF.

## How it works
It is very simple. The first parameter that is required is the path to the video file, currently mp4 format only, that you want to use. The second argument denotes the timestamp in the video that you want to begin your GIF at. The third argument represents the timestamp in the video that you want to end your GIF at.
It is also possible to give an optional parameter `--save_to` as a way to control where the newly generated GIF is actually exported to.
